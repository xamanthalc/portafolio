            <h2> Hi! This is Xamantha. 
               Born and raised in Peru, I discovered my passion for technology in college. 
               My work experience includes working as a student assistant at an Ed-tech company, interning at Mckinsey & Company for two summers
               as a Business Analyst, and working as a Peer Mentor and TA for the Statistics and Computer Science Department at Northwestern Univeristy.

               <p> 
                  I was born and raised in Lima-Peru and ever since I have memory I have been passionate about education. 
                  Thus, as a grew up, I always enjoyed teaching just as much I loved learning. <br><br>
                  When I was 17, I got an scholarship to finish highschool in a boarding school in Costa Rica called United World Colleges. 
                  That was the place where I spoke English in daily basis for the first time, learned subjects I had never been taught back home, heard about my peers' countries and cultures, and made the best friendships. This was also the place where I learned that it was possible to apply to colleges in the US. <br><br>
                  In March 2020, I got stuck in Costa Rica due to borders closing because of Covid-19, so I decided to take a job as a Student Assistant at an Ed-tech company called CanopyLab. I was in charge of creating partnerships with NGOs, translating courses, and delivering course certificates to students. I decided to continue with the job during my freshman year of college at Northwestern University. <br><br>

                  I came to college pretty set on studying something business-related and I had no interested in CS since I had never even heard of the field back home. However, because of my job, I started thinking that if I could automate the process of delivering certificates I would save many hours of work. That's when I decided to take my first CS class and... the rest is history. I fell in love with Computer Science and on the way I started learning about Data Science, so I decided to do a BA/MS program with a BA in Statistics and MS in Computer Science. <br><br>

                  I have had the opportunity to do a freshman and a sophomore year internship in consulting at McKinsey & Company where I learned topics ranging from UX design and Cybersecurity to digital transformation. Moreover, I have continued my passion for education by working as Peer Mentor for the Computer Science Department and as a Teaching Assistant for the Statistics Department. I also work as a Research Computing Student Consultant for Northwestern Information Technology (NUIT) where I help the research community use High-Performance Computing resources to advance their research through tutorials and one-to-one consultations. Starting January 2023, I will be working as a volunteer teaching programming to children in Evanston.<br><br>

                  I am very interested in working in the intersection of business and technology and I am now focused in continue developing my technical skills, I am therefore looking for internship opportunities wioth roles such as Data Science and Software Engineering.
